.SH OPTIONS
.IP -phs
Offset phase for the profile,
.br
1 Double value between 0 and 1.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -p
The folding period (s),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -pd
The folding period derivative (s/s),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -pdd
The folding period 2nd derivative (s/s^2),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -f
The folding frequency (hz),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -fd
The folding frequency derivative (hz/s),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -fdd
The folding frequency 2nd derivative (hz/s^2),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -n
The number of bins in the profile.  Defaults to the number of sampling bins which correspond to one folded period,
.br
1 Int value.
.IP -psr
Name of pulsar to fold (do not include J or B),
.br
1 String value
.IP -rzwcand
The candidate number to fold from 'infile'_rzw.cand,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and oo.
.IP -rzwfile
Name of the rzw search file to use (include the full name of the file),
.br
1 String value
.IP -bincand
Fold a binary pulsar but take the input data from this candidate number in 'infile'_bin.cand,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and oo.
.IP -onoff
A list of white-space separated pairs of numbers from 0.0 to 1.0 that designate barycentric times in our data set when we will actually keep the data. (i.e. '-onoff 0.1 0.4 0.7 0.9' means that we will fold the data set during the barycentric times 0.1-0.4 and 0.7-0.9 of the total time length of the data set),
.br
1 String value
.IP -bin
Fold a binary pulsar.  Must include all of the following parameters.
.IP -pb
The orbital period (s),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -x
The projected orbital semi-major axis (lt-sec),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -e
The orbital eccentricity,
.br
1 Double value between 0 and 0.9999999.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -To
The time of periastron passage (MJD),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and oo.
.IP -w
Longitude of periastron (deg),
.br
1 Double value between 0 and 360.
.IP -wdot
Rate of advance of periastron (deg/yr),
.br
1 Double value.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -xwin
Send graphics output to the screen.
.IP -ps
Send graphics output to a Postscript file.
.IP -both
Send graphics output both the screen and a Postscript file.
.IP -disp
Don't calculate a new profile.  Just display a previously calculated profile in 'infile'.prof.  Must be called with either -ps or -xwin.
.IP -mak
Determine folding parameters from 'infile.mak'.
.IP -noerr
Do not plot error bars.
.IP infile
Input data file name (without a suffix) of floating point data.  A '.inf' file of the same name must also exist..

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
